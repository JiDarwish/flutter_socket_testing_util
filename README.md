# Websocket testing utility

This is a very simple utility we'll use to test out websocket endpoints. It only has a text field where you can write your message and send it and any reply
would be logged to the console.

## To use

1. In the config file change the url to whatever it is on your device (on macs you can just use `localhost` instead of the ip address)
2. Use an http client to obtain an authorization token and fill that in Config.token
